# Bootstrap-Practice-01
Student Project
Just some practice work experimenting with Bootstrap, CSS, and Frameworks
This should load as a very simple webpage. 
Feel free to look over and use anything interesting. MIT license I think.
Shouldn't be any authentication or passwords needed.
This was a solo project.
